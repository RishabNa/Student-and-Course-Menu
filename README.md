# Student-and-Course-Menu
# This program allows you to input Students and Courses and gives them an identity throughout the commands of the system 
# To use this correctly, input the amount of students you want to input and then a menu will pop-up
# You will then be given a menu to either go add students or add courses
# Clicking on the the Student menu, you have to create a new student first by inputing their first and last name as well as their school year to generate a student with a random ID 
# After doing this you are given the freedom to experiement with the rest of the student and course menu
